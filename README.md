# ðŸš€ AI Lead Scoring Assignment

This project is an *AI-powered lead scoring system* designed to help sales and marketing teams prioritize their prospects effectively.

It combines *rule-based scoring* (role relevance, industry match, data completeness) with *AI-driven intent classification* (via OpenAI API) to assign a *final score (0â€“100)* for each lead.  
The system allows users to:

- ðŸ“Œ *Define product offers* (value propositions, ideal use cases).
- ðŸ“‚ *Upload leads in CSV format*.
- ðŸ§® *Run hybrid scoring* (Rules + AI).
- ðŸ“Š *Get ranked results* with reasoning for transparency.

This enables *faster outreach* and ensures teams focus on *high-intent decision-makers*, improving conversion rates.

Built with *Spring Boot, packaged via **Maven, deployed on **Render, and optionally runnable inside **Docker*.
